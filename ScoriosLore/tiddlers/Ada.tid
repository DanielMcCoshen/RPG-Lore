type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A large town, or a small city depending on who you ask. It's close proximity to the [[Temple of Traks]] and [[The Great Library]] gives it a sense of unity and order uncommon in [[Eduin|The Kingdom of Eudin]]. The sense of culture in Ada leads to some locals believing that they should be made the capital in place of [[Novi Dorringrad]], though most non-locals would disagree. The strong presence from the Temple of Traks makes it a common stop for those on pilgrimages, and clergy of all ranks in the Church of Order.
