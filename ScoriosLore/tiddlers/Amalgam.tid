!The Legend
The Amalgam is a [[dæmon|Dæmons]] of legend, and the antagonist of [[The Legend of the Three]]. It is said that they rose to threaten the world during the [[Age of War|The Age of War]], and were only defeated by the combined power of the three heros. The legend varies whether The Amalgam is simply a very powerful dæmon, wheter they are the ruler of dæmons, or whether they are the most powerful dæmon to ever exist. The story is that The Amalgam was not killed at their defeat, but was sealed somehow. Eventually, as the stories go, The Amalgam will break free from their prison to resume their reign of terror.
