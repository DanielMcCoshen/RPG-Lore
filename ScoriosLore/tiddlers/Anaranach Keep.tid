Anaranach Keep is a castle deep in [[The Belt]]. Not much is truly known other than it being the place where the first [[Elf-King|The Elf-Kings]], Karol, held the peace talks which ended the [[Age of War|The Age of War]].

There are, however, tales told about the Keep. These tales talk about the awe inspiring size and beauty of the castle, which almost seemed to have been formed on it's own, without the aid of mortals, and perhaps even without the gods. 

Some even say the fortress had no creator, that it simply grew out of the great mountains and is still ever-growing in size and splendor. Even fewer tell that the castle is alive, and that it is more than willing to defend itself from attackers yet eager to house guests all the same.
