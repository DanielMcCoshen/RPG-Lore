title: Calden - The Stronghold
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The  Old Stronghold used to be the castle of [[Calden]] before the abandonment of The Old Town. It was abandoned with the rest of the old town, and was out of use untill L1307. In L1307, it was brought back into use by [[Duke Arimani Albena]] as a prison and headquaters for the town guards. Over the years, the whole stronghold was converted almost entirely to prison, and in 260 [[Duke Ewald Albena]] began a project to dig tunnels beneath the city to create more prison space. Now when someone refers to the stronghold, they do not just mean the imposing structure within abandoned Old Town, but the complex of tunnels beneath as well
