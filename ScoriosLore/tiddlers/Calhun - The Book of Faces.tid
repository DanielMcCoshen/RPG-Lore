title: Calhun - The Book of Faces
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Book of Faces is a registry created by [[Morek Zukalbe]] containing all the information that he has collected about the citizens of [[Calhun]]. It began as a single tome, but has grown to an entire library. Zukalbe employs scribes who continually update the library as new information is leaned about different people. For a fee, one can purchase time to view select information from the Book of Faces. What one can view is magically limited to what they paid for, and subscriptions are available to be notified of changes to specific information.
