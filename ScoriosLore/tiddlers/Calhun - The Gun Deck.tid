title: Calhun - The Gun Deck
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Calhun]]'s Upper City began as a defensive installation, and it still is, to some degree. The outer ring of [[airships|Airships]] which make it up are controlled by a defensive force which answers to the council of trade lords. These soldires maintain cannons and mana projectors capable of firing on anything in any direction of the city. The gun deck has been built to run between ships in a continuous, unbroken ring.
