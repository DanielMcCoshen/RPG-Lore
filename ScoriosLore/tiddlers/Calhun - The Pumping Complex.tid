title: Calhun - The Pumping Complex
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Located behind the waterfall of [[Calhun]], this ancient complex dates back to [[The Age of War]]. It consists of 3 resevoirs cut into rock face behind the falls, filling from the waterfall itself. Each resevoir has several water wheels powering ocilating pumps which draw water from the resevoirs and pump it through pipes drilled in the rock of the cliffs to the city above. In recent times, the trade lords have decided not to upkeep the mechanism, as the Upper City does not rely on it, and uses magical sources of water instead. The complex has been declared dangerous and is therefore off-limits to citizens.
