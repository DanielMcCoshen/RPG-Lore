The gods and goddesses that are revered in the world are split into two separate pantheons of gods: the gods of order and the gods of turmoil. The two pantheons are ruled over by the twin gods, Domeya and Heliox, who are believed to be the first two beings to emerge from [[Void|The Void]], but their differing ideologies drove them to eternal conflict.
