type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Dorringrad woods are a small area of woodland between the crater where [[Dorringrad]] used to be and [[The Great Marsh]]. They were the historical hunting grounds of [[House Selryn]] during [[The Age of Light]], and are now home to a population of left-over magical beasts that had been imported to be hunted. While easier to travel through than [[Blackwood Forest]], these creatures create a risk to travelers.
