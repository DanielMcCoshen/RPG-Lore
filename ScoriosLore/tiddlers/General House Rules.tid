* Shields are always considered improvised weapons
* Planeshift and simmilar effects can still transport you to other planes, but be warned, most planes that are not the material plane are not conductive to supporting mortal life without serious preparation
* Effects that refer to the "Astral Plane" instead refer to [[The Void]]
