The Highpeak Mountains are a mountain range between [[The Lowlands]] of [[Eudin|The Kingdom of Eudin]] and [[Ardos|The Kingdom of Ardos]]. Their foothills extend up from [[The Belt]], and were the route that the forces of Ardos entered Eudin during [[The Fall]]. The northern end of the mountains meet the southern end of [[Blackwood Forest]].
