Magic is a force that comes from the foundational [[planes|The Planes]] of existance. [[Elves]] are capable of sensing this force and shaping it with their will in order to produce supernatural effects. [[Humans]] and [[Dwarves]] are incapable of sensing the flow of magic, and can not cast magic. The energy of all magic originates from the [[Void|The Void]], the plane of pure magical energy. This energy is too much for an individual to handle directly, and those who attempt are often killed or dirven mad by it. However the rumours of rare individuals who are somehow capable of harnising pure void energy keep researchers trying.

!!Attunements
Magic is devided first by the three planes that it comes from, the foundational planes of [[Creation|The Plane of Creation]], [[Alteration|The Plane of Alteration]], and [[Destruction|The Plane of Destruction]]. The magic of each of these three planes is then devided by three again, into Attunements, sometimes also refered to as Schools of Magic or Spheres of Magic. Each Plane has a core attunement, one that is central to what it is. Destruction is fire, Creation is Earth, and Alteration is Water. Each also has two border attunements, places within the plane where its energy mingles with that of the other foundational planes. These attunements must be accessed by first attuning onself to the foundational plane, and then to the specific attunement within the plane.

!!Patrons
A stong supernatual being, usually either a [[Faerie|Fae]], or a [[Dæmon|Dæmons]], can grant the ability to cross attune a border attunement to a different plane. This changes the way that the border attunement behaves. The boarder that can be cross-attuned is granted by the patron, and the person taking advantage of this can then attune that boarder to any foundational plane that they have an attuement with. For example, attuning healing to destruction grants the ability to consume the energy from the target, causing the same harm to them that the healing spell would normaly cure.

When a patron is used, the incant changes from //I attune [Plane] to [Attunement]// to //[Patron] attunes [Plane] to [Attunement]//. eg //Erian attunes Healing to Destruction ...// 

!!Divine magic
Those that have devoted themselves to a particular [[god|Deities]] are granted attunment to [[Divine|Divine Attunement]] magic. Divine magic is magic that is pulled directly from the god in question through one of the foundational planes to be used. It can be channeled through any foundational plane that the caster has attunement to, and its effects change depending on witch plane it is channeled throguh.
