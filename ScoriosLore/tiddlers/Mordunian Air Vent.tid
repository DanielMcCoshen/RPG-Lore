title: Mordunian Air Vent
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Mordunian Air Vents are a common structure in the hills to the north of [[The Lowlands]] and the south of [[The Great Marsh]]. They are hollow brick pillairs extending up from the ground, often apparently in the middle of nowhere. They are connected to the ventilation system of [[The Mines of Mordun]] and are either smoke output or air intake. They can often be seen smoking, but not as much as they did in the past during [[The Age of Light]], due to the better infrastructure in the mines.
