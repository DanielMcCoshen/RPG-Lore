!Discription
Mountain Dwarves are a rare sight in [[Edion|The Realm of Edion]]. They are native to the mines and tunnels that they have dug beneath [[The Belt]] and rarely come out. Those who live in society in any of the three kingdoms have ether been exiled or have left their people for some other deeply personal reason.
