!Discription
Mountain Dwarves, unlike their [[gremlin|Gremlins]] and [[gnomish|Gnomes]] cousins are a rare sight in [[Edion|The Realm of Edion]]. They are native to  [[The Dwarven Kingdoms]] beneath [[The Belt]] and rarely come to the surface. Those that leave the Kingdoms to live elsewhere on [[Scorios]] generally do so due to exile or other deeply personal reasons.

Mountain Dwarves are short [[dwarven|Dwarves]] creatures. They are taller than other Dwarves, though not by much. Mountain Dwarves, regardless of sex sport long beards that are structured in such a way that they filter dust, debris, and toxins from the air that they breate. These beards are a point of pride for Mountain Dwarves, and to shave a dwarf is great sign of disrespect, not only culturally, but becuase doing so exposes them to the hazardous rock dust that permiates their subterainian homes.

Mountain dwarves can live about as long as [[Elves]], living up to 300 years.

!Culture
!!Beards
Mountain Dwarves are vey connected to their beards. It is a symbol of status, and what literally keeps them alive. As a Mountain Dwarf's beard grows, it preseves the dwarf's history.  Old dwarves can often have beards several metres in length, and cary them wrapped around their bodies. At death, a dwarf's beard is shaved off and woven into their family's family tapistry. These tapistries are artisitc expression and living records of a family history.

The greatest punishments in dwarven society invlolve desecration of ones beard. When one has commited a grevous crime, they can be ordered to be shaved. This is symbolic of death, and whether or not the crime is actually punished by death as well, the shaven dwarf is treated as though they were dead. If the crime brings enough dishour to their family, the family will burn the beard when they are presented with it, rather than adding it to their tapistry.  Shaving oneself can also be done in to kill ones on past, and move on. This is often done by dwarves who move out of the Kingdoms into the rest of the world.
