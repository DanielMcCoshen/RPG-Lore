title: Player Housing
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Your character may find it appropriate at some point time to own a home or property of some variety, be it a lair on the side of a mountain for your evil experiments, a cute cottage for you and your family, or a warehouse used for manufacturing the weapons you supply to your customers, the option is available to you. To own housing, you must first own land. Once you own land, you can realistically do whatever you would like with it, even if that's something simple as pitch a tent and start a campfire.

!Purchasing Land
To get started with owning a structure, you must purchase
land first. Land costs vary depending on the location the land
is bought in, and the economic state of said location.
Land is purchased in acres, and is located in towns or
cities. Depending on the economic quality of the land you
purchase, it will have different amounts of access to services,
upgrades, and hirelings. The monthly upkeep of land must be
paid every month or the land becomes unusable.

!!Land Costs
Apply demand modifiers to the cost of land as appropriate.

|!Land |!Monthly Upkeep |!Cost |
|1 Acre, Squalid |12o |2z |
|1 Acre, Poor |2z 10o |1f |
|1 Acre, Modest |2v |1f 1v |
|1 Acre, Comfortable |1f |10f |
|1 Acre, Wealthy |2f |25f |
|1 Acre, Aristocratic |4f |100f |
|//Demand Modifiers// |<|<|
|None |<|/4|
|Low |<|/2|
|High |<|*1.5 |
|Soaring |<|*2 |

!!Claiming Land
Instead of purchasing land in a town traditionally, you can
instead claim land in the wild. When you do this, it instead
costs 1 gp per acre, and demand modifiers do not effect you.

!Selling Housing
When you sell houses you sell them for half of the price you
purchased them. Add the price of all present upgrades to this price when
determining the sell value.

!Building Housing
Once you've purchased your land, you may then build on that land. You build structures based on size, and that size then translates to a resource called 'room points'. Your building has a number of room points which are taken up when your structure is upgraded. You cannot upgrade a building if you do not have the required room points. Different housing sizes cost different amounts of acres. You cannot build more housing than you have acres of owned land. Once you build an upgrade, to remove it you must spend 500 gold. When you build housing, you must choose the owned location in which you build it. The price of different sizes of housing will be effected in different ways depending on the quality of the land, and the location it was built. It takes a number of days equal to the cost of a structure or upgrade divided by 50 to build.

!!Housing Costs
|!Structure Size |!Room Points |!Acre Requirement |!Construction Cost |
|Small |1 |.5 |150f |
|Medium |2 |1 |250f |
|Large |4 |2 |400f |
|Huge |8 |4 |650f |
|Giant |16 |8 |1200f |
|Colossus |32 |16 |2000f |

!!Economic Modifiers & Upgrae Availability
Depending on the quality of the land you are attempting to build in, it may cost different amounts to construct your home or your upgrades. These modifiers apply to both housing and constructed upgrades, following the chart shown below.

Different upgrades will have different ranks, and depending on the rank the cost to construct will be modified. Each economic condition has a rank associated with it as shown in the chart below.

Multiply an upgrades construction cost by X, where X is twice the number of ranks higher the upgrade is than the land it you are attempting to build it on.

|!Economic Condition |!Cost Multiplier |!Upgrade Rank |
|Wild |*2 |0 |
|Squalid |*2 |1 |
|Poor |*1 |2 |
|Modest |*1 |3 |
|Comfortable |*1 |4 |
|Wealthy |*1 |5 |
|Aristocratic |*1 |6 |
