title: Ruins of Bel-Ador
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The ruins of what was once a great city, home to many renowned scholars, wizards, artificers, and possibly even the precursor to the [[The Great Library]]. That, however, is now far in the past. During the [[Age of War|The Age of War]] the humans of Bel-Ador believed they had found a way to grant themselves the ability to cast [[magic|Magic]]. Their experiments were met with success, but at an incredible cost. Most if not all of the non-humans in the city died in minutes, and the [[Bel-Adorian]] humans who survived became twisted forms of their previous selves.

What is left of the former city is a mess of malformed buildings, terrain and small animals, the centuries of demonic energy corrupting the surrounding land. Fear of the "Demon City" keeps most away from the South centre of [[Eudin|The Kingdom of Eudin]].
