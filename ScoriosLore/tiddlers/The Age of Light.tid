!!Description
The Age of Light was a great time of peace and prosperity in the Realm. Knowledge of [[magic|Magic]] and technology grew over the next seven generations of [[Elf|Elves]] and twenty one generations of [[Human|Humans]]. [[The Elf-Kings]] ruled wisely and kindly. They promoted the fusion of magic and technology, and by the end of the age, many things were made possible that should not have been. Mammoth airships sailed though the skies, magically held aloft on the currents of [[void|The Void]] energy that permeated the universe, propelled by wind and mechanical engines that belched steam. Magical light was made possible at the turning of a valve. Ground vehicles began to drive under their own power. And weaponry increased too. 

It was a time of great progress, but it was also a time of unparalleled social stratification. The rich lived lavishly, but the poor were left to the wayside. In [[The Kingdom of Durek]] discontentment built until it reached a head.
