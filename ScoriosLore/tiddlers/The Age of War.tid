!!Description
For ten generations, there was peace between the Kingdoms, but it was not to last. The line of Ardos was the fist to fall, and a new king rose to power in the kingdom of [[Ardos|The Kingdom of Ardos]]. Damir, the king of [[Durek|The Kingdom of Durek]] at the time came to know of this and believing that the throne should only be held by a descendant of [[Heliox]], he attacked [[Ardos|The Kingdom of Ardos]] with all the force he could muster. Damir lived until his fifty-second year, being killed while hunting. After his death his son Rhen took over the throne. 

Rhen held the views of his father, but was more radical in his approach. Rhen renewed the war effort, and forced every man of fighting age in [[Durek|The Kingdom of Durek]] to join the army. It was during the reign of Rhen that the first [[Elves]] crossed the mountain range known as [[The Belt]] from the south. 

They crossed into Eudin over the narrowest part of [[The Belt]]. The [[Elves]] were much longer lived than the [[Humans]], but did not have the quality of technology the humans had. The arms and armour of these elves were still bronze, and the humans had leaned how to work steel generations ago. The elves however had something no human had: a power to channel an energy that had long since passed into myth among the humans. They could make works of [[magic|Magic]] no human hand ever dreamed of since [[Heliox]] himself had told stories of the time before time, when he and his [[sister|Domeya]] could make anything they wanted through the power of magic.

It was then that King Rhen of [[Durek|The Kingdom of Durek]] was assassinated. A mother of a man he had forced off to war had requested an audience. Not suspecting a seventy year old capable of such a thing, he let his guard down in her presence and she stabbed him through the throat, just how her son had died a few weeks earlier. 

With another one of the descendants of [[Heliox]] dead, and without a child to take his place, one of the high nobles of [[Durek|The Kingdom of Durek]] ascended to the throne. With two of the three decedents of [[Heliox]] dead, the new king of [[Durek|The Kingdom of Durek]] and the king of [[Ardos|The Kingdom of Ardos]] forged a pact to kill the third, and they set their sights upon the kingdom of [[Eudin|The Kingdom of Eudin]]. 

Fearing for the safety of the king, the last known descendant of [[Heliox]], the leader of the Elves, one of the descendants of [[Domeya]], took him and his family back over the mountains to the south, installing a decoy king in his place. The decoy was assassinated within a couple years of his instillation. 

Thinking their king killed, a new monarch rose to power and rallied [[Eudin|The Kingdom of Eudin]] behind him, fighting back against the other two kingdoms, and gaining support within those kingdoms themselves. 

With there being no longer any descendants of [[Heliox]] or [[Domeya]] among the [[Humans]] and elves living in Edion, their names faded into legend, legend faded into myth.

It was during this time that the [[legend of the Three|The Legend of the Three]] began to circulate. The Legend was that of three warriors, each without weapons or armour, and each with mastery over one of the four elements of the world, welding them as not even the elves and their magic could.

The war raged on for twenty-four more generations of man and eight generations of elf. It became a simple fact of life for the inhabitants of the Realm. Eventually one figure, an elf stepped forward quell the fighting. 

This elf, [[Karol|King Karol]], brought the three [[human|Humans]] kings together in a [[fortress|Anaranach Keep]], grown seamlessly from a mountain in the middle of [[The Belt]]. The four of them discussed within the castle for six months, during witch time no one else came to them or heard from them. When they returned the four stood on a cliff overlooking a valley and made a decree. The realm would be united under one king, who would rule from [[Eudin|The Kingdom of Eudin]], as Eudin had not started the war, and only defended. The other two kingdoms would pledge their loyalty to [[Eduin|The Kingdom of Eudin]]. Because every conflict had been started by human hand, it had also been decided that an elf should be the ruler of the Realm. Thus Karol was named the first [[Elf-King|The Elf-Kings]] of Edion. 

With the crowning Karol, the Age of War ended, and so began the [[Age of Light|The Age of Light]], the first golden age of Edion.
