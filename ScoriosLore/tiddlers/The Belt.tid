type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The belt is the wide and impassible mountain range separating all of [[Edion|The Realm of Edion]] from the land to the south. No one has attempted to pass though it and succeeded, but it is told the [[Elves]] did cross it from the south during the [[Age of War|The Age of War]], and [[Dwarves]] emerged from their tunnels below it.

It is rumoured that deep in the belt somewhere is a vast living stone [[castle|Anaranach Keep]], the place of the peace talks that ended the [[Age of War|The Age of War]], but no one is quite sure where it is, and no one would be able to reach it.
