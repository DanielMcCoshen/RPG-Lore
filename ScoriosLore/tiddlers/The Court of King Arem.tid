title: The Court of King Arem
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

An apparent heir to the line of [[Ceremor|King Ceremor]] has emerged in the figure of [[King Arem]]. Not much is known about him and his upbringing, but when he was a young adult he began to pull a small following claiming to be the heir to the crown of [[Eudin|The Kingdom of Eudin]]. His following began to grow to a size to rival Calhun's [[trade lords|The Trade Lords of Calhun]] and he installed himself  as king in [[Novi Dorringrad]]. In the two generations of humans since, the court of Arem has grown to be one of the most powerful and influential factions in Eudin. 

The influence of the court of King Arem exists primarily through [[Calden]], [[Buntenberry]] and [[Ada]], however supporters of Arem can be found as far away as [[Hopper]].
