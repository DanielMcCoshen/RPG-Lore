The Great Marsh is a near-impassible marsh that spans much of Eudin. It extends from where [[Dorringrad]] used to be all the way past [[Calden]] and [[Vernwyn]]. The inhospitable marsh is part of the reason that [[Eudin|The Kingdom of Eudin]] held out so long against Ardos. Adventures often brave the marsh chasing rumours of lost treasure, but rarely return.
