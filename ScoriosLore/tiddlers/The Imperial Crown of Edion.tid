title: The Imperial Crown of Edion
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Imperial Crown of Edion was a golden crown fasioned in the image of several crows. It was lost in an airship collision above [[Lyrin Bay]] that killed [[King Rys Selryn]]. The crown was enchanted to always fit the head of the true emperor of Edion. The Crown has recently resurfaced in the posession of [[King Arem Selryn]], and is a major part of the king's claim to the throne.
