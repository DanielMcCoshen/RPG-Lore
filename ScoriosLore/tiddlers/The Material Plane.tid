The material plane is the plane of existance that the world of Scorios exists on. It includes the planet, the sky, the stars, and their planets and is built upon the three Foundational Planes of [[Creation|The Plane of Creation]], [[Alteration|The Plane of Alteration]], and [[Destruction|The Plane of Destruction]]. All mortals are born, live, and die, on the material plane, and anything made of matter originates on this plane.
