On the plane of creation, there exists the mirror of the structure of the material plane. and echos of the structure of everything that ever was. There is no air on the plane of creation, and those who travel there must ether not require breath, or have some way of supplying air themselves. For this reason, the primary researchers about the plane of Creation tend to be [[Mechanathari]].
