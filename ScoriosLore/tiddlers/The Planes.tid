Each of the planes are built upon one another and their structure mimics the structure of the triviums of [[magic|Magic]]. At the base, there is the [[Void |The Void]], the plane witch contains nothing but the essence of magic. Layered onto the void, there are the three foundational planes of [[Creation|The Plane of Creation]], [[Alteration|The Plane of Alteration]], and [[Destruction|The Plane of Destruction]]. These three elemental planes then build the foundation for the [[Material Plane|The Material Plane]]. Above the mortal plane is the [[Ascendant Plane|The Ascendant Plane]], however no mortal mind has been able to grasp what exists there.
