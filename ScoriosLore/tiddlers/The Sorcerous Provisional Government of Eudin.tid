!History
The Sorcerous Provisional Government of Eudin was the state formed by [[The High Sorcerers of Eudin]] after the assassination of [[King Ceremor Selryn]] in order to govern [[The Kingdom of Eudin]] in the fight against [[The Kingdom of Ardos]] during [[The Fall]]. There was no clear successor in [[House Selryn]], and while succession was being sorted out, the provisional government fought the war. The Sorcereous Provisional Government was destroyed along with [[Dorringrad]] during [[The Seige of Dorringrad]].
