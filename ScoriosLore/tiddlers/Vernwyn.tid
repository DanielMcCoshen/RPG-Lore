Vernwen is a large town located at the point where [[The Great Marsh]] touches [[The Darknight Woods]]. Because of this, the town has a large Wood Elf population, and a religious leaning towards [[Heliox]] and [[the Pantheon of Discord|Deities]] in general. Vernwyn sees itself as an independent religious community, and intends to stay that way. The town is run as a theocracy, and the Church of Discord holds all political power, despite allegations of corruption. 

In reality the church leader has been corrupted by [[The Trade Lords of Calhun]] and is a puppet. This is obvious to anyone looking from the outside, but the citizens of Vernwyn and area have such complete faith in their leader that they refuse to believe even the most condemning proof.
