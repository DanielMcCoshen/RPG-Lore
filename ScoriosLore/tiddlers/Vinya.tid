!Teachings of her adhearants
Those who follow Vinya are the honourable and the just. They believe that in battle treating an opponent with respect and dignity is what matters most. Worshippers will  always accept a surrender, taking prisoners before striking down an unarmed opponent. For most worshippers, this continues off the battlefield and into civil life, caring about honour in law and justice for those wronged. Fanatical worshippers of Vinya often seek conflict, taking arms at the slightest insult or provocation.
